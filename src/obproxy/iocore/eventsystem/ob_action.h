/**
 * Represents an operation initiated on a ObProcessor.
 *
 * The ObAction class is an abstract representation of an operation
 * being executed by some ObProcessor. A reference to an ObAction object
 * allows you to cancel an ongoing asynchronous operation before it
 * completes. This means that the ObContinuation specified for the
 * operation will not be called back.
 *
 * Actions or classes derived from ObAction are the typical return
 * type of methods exposed by Processors in the ObEvent System and
 * throughout the IO Core libraries.
 *
 * The canceller of an action must be the state machine that will
 * be called back by the task and that state machine's lock must be
 * held while calling cancel.
 *
 * ObProcessor implementers:
 *
 * You must ensure that no events are sent to the state machine after
 * the operation has been cancelled appropriately.
 *
 * Returning an ObAction:
 *
 * ObProcessor functions that are asynchronous must return actions to
 * allow the calling state machine to cancel the task before completion.
 * Because some processor functions are reentrant, they can call
 * back the state machine before the returning from the call that
 * creates the actions. To handle this case, special values are
 * returned in place of an action to indicate to the state machine
 * that the action is already completed.
 *
 *   - @b (ret = OB_SUCCESS && NULL == action) The processor has completed
 *     the task and called the state machine back inline.
 *   - @b (ret = OB_SUCCESS && NULL != action) asynchronous task.
 *   - @b (ret != OB_SUCCESS) failed.
 *
 * To make matters more complicated, it's possible if the result is
 * (ret = OB_SUCCESS && NULL == action)that state machine deallocated itself on the
 * reentrant callback. Thus, state machine implementers MUST either
 * use a scheme to never deallocate their machines on reentrant
 * callbacks OR immediately check the returned action when creating
 * an asynchronous task and if it is (ret = OB_SUCCESS && NULL == action) neither read
 * nor write any state variables. With either method, it's imperative
 * that the returned action always be checked for special values and
 * the value handled accordingly.
 *
 * Allocation policy:
 *
 * Actions are allocated by the ObProcessor performing the actions.
 * It is the processor's responsibility to handle deallocation once
 * the action is complete or cancelled. A state machine MUST NOT
 * access an action once the operation that returned the ObAction has
 * completed or it has cancelled the ObAction.
